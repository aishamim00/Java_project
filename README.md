## Project on Java Quiz System
#### admin can save multiple MCQ with 4 options with their answer key and when any student logs in to the system, system will tell the student to give MCQ exam from the quiz bank.
#### In this way, 10 questions will be shown and finally the system will show the result and the answer will not show from the json. Just match the json file answer key with the user input key. If matches, score should be counted. Otherwise if user input wrong or invalid number from keyboard, it will be considered as 0 mark and generate the next question.

#### For an example output:

- if mark is above 8>= message: Excellent! You have got [marks] out of 10
- if mark is above 5>= but less than 8, message: Good. You have got [marks] out of 10
- if mark is above 2>= but less than 5, message: Very poor! You have got [marks] out of 10
